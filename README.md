# Truck-Flow
## Description 
This is project involves the development of a truck managment application in a warehouse scenario where trucks are allocated 1 of 4 ramps depending on the the type of cargo.

## Softwares used
* Python
* SQL Workbench
  
## Process Flow
1. Employee selects their respective designation (Security/Employee) in the console.
   _NOTE: Each has a different set of commands_

2. The security personnel first registers the truck into the database. This includes inputting details like- Vehicle Registration Number, Cargo Type, Driver's Name, Contact details etc.

4. After registration the trucks are halted in a waiting area to form a queue and await ramp allocation.
   The security personnel is also able to view the current waiting queue as well as the truck details.

6. Next the manager logs in to their console and is greeted by the following options:

8. The manager is able to view the current queue in the waiting area.

10. The manager can also check the status of each of the ramps and also check which truck is currently occupying it.

12. Next the manager empties one of the occupied ramps. This automatically allocates the ramp to a truck in the waiting area with the cooresponding cargo type.

## Conclusion:
While this project may not be suitable for immediate deployment in an industrial scenario, It however illustrates the basic workflow and process of a simple truck flow mangement system. This knowledge can later be scaled up usingother suitable tools and mediums which meet upto the industrial standards.
